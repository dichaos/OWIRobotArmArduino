# OWIRobotArmArduino
Control OWI Robot Arm with arduino and ardafruit. I couldn't make my old OWI robot arm to work with windows 10. So, I attached the motors to an adafruit. 
I connected the arduino to my PC's usb port and I wrote this small piece of code that read's the input from a generic usb controller and sends the signals to the arduino.
This was another attempt to fill up my time during the 2020 Covid-19 outbreak.
